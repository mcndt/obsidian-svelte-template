Welcome to the tutorial vault for using Svelte with Obsidian!

## Getting started

This vault has been initialized with the "Hot reload" plugin, so whenever you make changes to your plugin, the vault will instantly reload your code.

To get started, copy the `.env.tutorial` file and rename it to `.env`. 

Next, start the development script:

```shell
npm run dev
```

If all goes well, the plugin should now be hot reloading as you code (may have to reload the Obsidian window the first time).

The tutorial starts on the git branch `workshop-start`, so check out that branch if you are not on it already.
