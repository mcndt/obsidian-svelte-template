We only scratched the surface of what is possible with Svelte. If you want to learn more, I highly recommend going to the documentation website. Every page is an interactive tutorial, so you can learn hands-on, itâ€™s really good.

If you want to see example code of Svelte used in real Obsidian plugins, you can check out my two plugins:

> - [*Toggl Track Integration for Obsidian (GitHub)*](https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-toggl-integration)
> - [*Obsidian QuickShare (GitHub)*](https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-quickshare)

The web viewer for my E2E-encrypted note sharing plugin is also written entirely in Svelte (using SvelteKit):

> - [*Noteshare.space (GitHub)*](https://github.com/mcndt/noteshare.space)
